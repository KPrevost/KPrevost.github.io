<h1>Sherlock Prevost</h1>

<p>Sherlock is an amazing dog. During his time with his family, he has consumed two couches, one chair, and countless 
food crumbs. He has also delivered dozens of bruises due to the significant force with which his tail is wagged. </p>

<p>A key quote about Sherlock: "Sherlock, I love you but not the lips" ... in response to SHerlock's aggressive 
  slippage of tongue.</p>
